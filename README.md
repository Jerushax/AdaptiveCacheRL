## üìò Overview

Traditional cache replacement algorithms such as **Least Recently Used (LRU)** and **Least Frequently Used (LFU)** rely on fixed heuristics that do not adapt to changing access patterns.  
This project introduces a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based adaptive cache replacement policy** using **Q-learning** to dynamically optimize cache performance.

The proposed approach improves **cache hit rate** and **reduces memory access latency** by learning from real-time memory access behaviors.

## üßÆ Algorithm: Q-Learning Cache Replacement

```text
1. Initialize Q-table for all cache lines (state‚Äìaction pairs)
2. For each memory access:
     if tag found:
         reward ‚Üê +1   (cache hit)
     else:
         reward ‚Üê ‚Äì1   (cache miss)
         replace line with lowest Q-value
3. Update:
     Q(s,a) ‚Üê Q(s,a) + Œ± [r + Œ≥ max_a' Q(s',a') ‚Äì Q(s,a)]
4. Continue training until reward convergence
